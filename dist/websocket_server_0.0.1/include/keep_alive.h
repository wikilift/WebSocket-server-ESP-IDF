/**
 * @file keep_alive.h
 * @brief KeepAlive class for managing client keep-alive functionality.
 * 
 * This file defines the KeepAlive class, which provides functionality for
 * managing keep-alive checks for WebSocket clients. It includes methods for
 * adding, removing, and updating clients, as well as starting and stopping
 * the keep-alive task.
 * 
 * This implementation is based on the `echoserver` example provided in the ESP-IDF framework.
